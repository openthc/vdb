# Cannavis Variety Database

A Variety (or Strain) Database for software in the Cannabis Industry

This code and data is provided for others who are in the cannabis software space to access a directory of variety names.
It aims to solve one (of the many) issues in the cannabis technology space regarding data entry.

This variety data follows our existing API/Data Model specifications and we hope is easy to integrate.
Of note, each Variety is assigned a unique, universally unique ID -- which you software can both use and depend on.
This allows software vendors to positively identify varieties between their respective systems.
